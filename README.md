# 👋 Hi, I'm Kaustubh

I'm an aspiring **Full Stack Web Developer**, making a career switch from the aviation industry to tech. I graduated in Hospitality Studies from DY Patil University and worked at Mumbai International Airport before fully committing to my passion for web development.

Currently, I’m learning the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and building real-world projects to sharpen my skills and contribute meaningfully to the developer community.
