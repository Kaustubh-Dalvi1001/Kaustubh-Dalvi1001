# 👋 Hi, I'm Kaustubh

## 🚀 Frontend Web Developer in the Making | MERN Stack Learner

I'm passionate about building intuitive, responsive web applications using modern technologies like **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **React**, **Vite**, **Bootstrap**, and more.  
Currently focused on mastering front-end development and creating real-world projects to strengthen my skills.

I'm also learning the **MERN stack** to expand into full-stack development soon.  
Previously worked in the aviation industry and hold a degree in Hospitality Studies from **DY Patil University**.
